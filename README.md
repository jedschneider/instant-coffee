# Instant Coffee

Instant Coffee is a development tool intended to be used for small
mostly-static projects that want to use CoffeeScript but don't want to depend
on node.js.  It is packaged as a dependencies-included jar, so it only requires
the JVM to run.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the `example-project` directory for a README and example setup for getting started. This would be a basic setup for using a framework like [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).

## Haml-js

Instant coffee uses a slightly modified version of the haml-js project. The primary
difference is that whitespace is added between sibling elements.

## Future Features

* SASS/SCSS
* Require declarations
